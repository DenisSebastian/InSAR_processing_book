## Processing SAR

### Data Access 

Need SLC products Source ASF, CopHub, etc.



### Data organisation

Delivered S1 SLC scenes do not consistently have the same coverage. Either do further processing at the "burst" level, or form new scenes from sets of bursts). The latter approach was used at GA.


### Co-registration of reference SLC to DEM 

This mapping is used later for interferogram geocoding

### Co-registration of other SLCs to reference

The co-registration of each S1 image needs to be better than 1/1000th of a pixel to avoid burst discontinuities. GA implemented a tree network structure to apply co-registrations and avoid propagating mis-registration in a large multi-year stack of 12 day images.

### Interferogram formation

Typically done with an "SBAS" network where every SAR image is used to form multiple interferograms for redundancy of information


### Interferogram unwrapping 

Convert fringes to continuous phase field using unsupervised algorithm like snaphu of MCF. These are good for automation but they do make mistakes (unwrapping errors)


### Geocoding 

Convert products (interferograms, coherence, backscatter) from radar to geographic geometry

## Time Series Processing

### Unwrapping check 

Throw out pixels that fail the check â€“ removes unwrapping errors

### Orbital error removal

Model long wavelength spatial trends and remove. Usually not that important for S1


### Atmospheric noise removal
Various approaches, best use external weather model data to generate a phase correction

### Network inversion for displacement time series

Pixel-wise process

### Network inversion for average displacement

Pixel-wise process for velocity
